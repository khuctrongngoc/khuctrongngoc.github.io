<h1>ACM ICPC Team</h1>
<p>
	There are a number of people who will be attending ACM-ICPC World Finals.
	Each of them may be well versed in a number of topics. Given a list of
	topics known by each attendee, presented as binary strings, determine the
	maximum number of topics a 2-person team can know. Each subject has a column
	in the binary string, and a '1' means the subject is known while '0' means
	it is not. Also determine the number of teams that know the maximum number
	of topics. Return an integer array with two elements. The first is the
	maximum number of topics known, and the second is the number of teams that
	know that number of topics.
